## The Voyage

 - Most recently I have been thinking a lot about my own relationship with technology. 
 - I think I rely on it too much. 
 - For too long has mindlessly wasting time been my default. For too long has my default been building up the capital of others instead of my own; consuming and not creating. This ends this summer.
 - I have detirmined that my own use of my phone, Snapchat and Youtube in particular are unhealthy and are used as comping mechanisms. Currently I am living alone on campus for a summer internship, and as all of my friends have moved away it can be lonely. 
  - Bam, thats when the phone takes over, lonliness -> lets wistfully see what our friends are doing. 
  - Tired from work -> lets watch obscure documentaries until we should have gone asleep an hour ago. 
 - The frightening thing is, that I can't help thinking how this is slowly but surely changing my brain over the long run. I am becoming less focused, less creative and less happy all because it can be more pleasurable to sit in my room and escape into the alternate reality portal of my phone than it can be to get around the thing that is causing me pain or fear at the current moment and get along with life. 
 - **It is the ultimate pause button.** I think too much of my life is on pause at the moment. 

I have tried to cut my phone out of my life before, but I havn't succeeded. I even bought a sketchpad and some art pencils with the thought that I would take up sketching instead, but that hasn't happened yet. 

I had a bunch of plans for the summer, pipe dreams and fantasies that havn't been realized. I find it too easy nowadays to be distracted by a fantasy, investingating it, watching Youtube videos on it, making my own motor neurons fire on it, finally extinguisihing it by chasing the next fantasy. Leaving in my wake a series of unfinished hopes and dreams, halfcompleted projects and unfullfilled promises. 


### The Trip to a Marathon
Last semester before winter break started I promised myself that I would run a marathon. I ran too far, too fast and in about a month I had gone back to my normal ways with a hip injury to boot. 

The dream of a marathon still calls to me. In a naive unthinking fashion, not fully congniscent of the long nights, hard days, aches and pains and sacrifices required.
